VIM NOTES!

TWO MODES:
- insert mode
- normal mode

i = go to insert mode
Esc = back to normal mode
----------------------------------------------
BASIC MOVEMENT IN VIM (characters):
- h,j,k,l

h = left
j = down
k = up
l = right
----------------------------------------------
WORD MOVEMENT IN VIM (words):
- w,b,e

w = start of next word
b = beginning of word
e = end of word
----------------------------------------------
COMBINING MOVEMENT KEYS WITH A NUMBER:
- (number)(key) = particular key function (number) amount of times

3w = pressing w three times

30i- Esc = inserting - 30 times (REMEMBER THE ESC AFTERWARDS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, WHATEVER YOU WRITE AFTERWARDS WILL BE INCLUDED ALONG WITH THE -)
----------------------------------------------
FINDING PARTICULAR OCCURENCES OF A CHARACTER:
-f + (a character), then F backwards

fo = find the next o

3fq = find the third occurence of q
----------------------------------------------
FINDING PARTICULAR OCCURENCES OF A WORD:
-*,#

* = find the next occurence of the word under the cursor
# = find the previous occurence of the word under the cursor
----------------------------------------------
JUMPING BETWEEN PARENTHESES:
-%

% = go to end of parentheses (or beginning)
----------------------------------------------
JUMP TO BEGINNING OR END OF LINES:
-0,$

0 = jump to the beginning of the line
$ = jump to the end of the line
----------------------------------------------
JUMP TO BEGINNING, END OF FILES OR PARTICULAR LINES:
-gg,G

gg = go to beginning of the file
G = go to end of the file

2G = go to line 2
----------------------------------------------
SEARCHING FOR TEXT:
-/,n,N

/apples = search for "apples"
n = go to next occurence of "apples"
N = go to previous occurence of "apples"
----------------------------------------------
INSERTING TEXT ONTO A NEW LINE:
-o,O

o = insert text on a new line
O = insert text on a line above the current line
----------------------------------------------
REMOVING A CHARACTER:
-x,X

x = remove the word under the cursor
X = remove the word to the left of the cursor
----------------------------------------------
REPLACING LETTER UNDER CURSOR:
-r

r + letter = replace the letter under the cursor
----------------------------------------------
DELETING THINGS:
-d

dw = deletes the first word on the right side of the cursor
p = pastes deleted word in other location (for some reason)
----------------------------------------------
REPEAT THE PREVIOUS COMMAND:
-.

. = repeats previous command
----------------------------------------------
VISUAL MODE:
-v,e,d

v = enter visual mode
e = select text

use movement keys to control how much highlighting you have
----------------------------------------------
OTHER IMPORTANT COMMANDS:

u = undo
ctrl + r = redo
:saveas (FILENAME) = save and name file
:w = "write" (save file)
:w !python = if the code is python, then you can run it with this command (READ ONLY; NO INPUT)
:w !sh = if the code is shell, then you can run it with this command (READ ONLY; NO INPUT)
:wq = save and quit
:q! = quit without saving
